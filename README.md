# weather

This web application will display current local weather conditions returned from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The source code is written in Java and created with
Spring Boot.

If you want to run this application, you will need to [sign up](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) for your own Weather API Key and assign it to the `API_KEY` String constant in the `WeatherServiceImpl` class. The [free service](https://www.weatherapi.com/pricing.aspx) allows for 1,000,000 API calls per month.
